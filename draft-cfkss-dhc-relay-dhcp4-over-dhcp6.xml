    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 the dual stack networks
      are common. Many architectures propose delivery mechanisms based on
      IPv6-only operator's networks while still offering IPv4 connectivity.
      In many cases, the host being configured
      with DHCPv4 protocol is separated from the DHCPv4 server by the IPv6 only
      network segment. Existing protocols do not allow for DHCPv4 traffic to
      traverse IPv6 network.</t>
      <t>This document describes extensions to DHCPv6 protocol to allow
      transmission of DHCPv4 traffic via DHCPv6 enabled network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use Cases">
      <t>To leverage existing deployed architecture and not require additional
      components to be deployed in the network, existing DHCPv6 relays are
      extended with the new functionality.</t>

      <t>The assumption that DHCPv4 packets can be encapsulated by the DHCPv6
      RELAY-FORWARD and RELAY-REPLY messages is fundamental for the extensions
      described in this document. Thus, if the DHCPv4 client is separated from
      the DHCPv4 server by the IPv6 network segment it is required that DHCPv6
      traffic is carried through this segment and that at least one relay agent
      resides on the route between the DHCP4 client and server.</t>

      <t>It is assumed that there is a DHCPv6 relay deployed on each
      link the clients are connected to.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="overview-dhcp6-server"/> shows the sample network
      topology where the traffic from both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients is directed
      to the same DHCP6 server. The unified relay agent conveys both v4 or v6
      messages in RELAY-FORW message described in section 7.1 of
      <xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315</xref>, but in two different options.
      The DHCPv6 messages are conveyed in OPTION_RELAY_MSG as described in the
      <xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315</xref> while the v4 messages are conveyed in the
      new option OPTION_RELAY_MSG4 defined in this document. This
      guarantees that relay agents and servers may easily differentiate the DHCPv4
      and DHCPv6 traffic by simply looking at the type of the option being carried
      in the RELAY-FORW message.</t>

      <t>Once the server has processed the message it sends back the response to
      the relay agent in the RELAY-REPL message described in section 7.2 of
      <xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315</xref>. Server uses OPTION_RELAY_MSG4 to
      relay responses to DHCPv4 requests.</t>

      <t>The topology presented above requires that not only is DHCP6 server
      capable to process DHCP6, but also DHCP4 traffic. Such hybrid
      implementations are common and in many cases can be created with a minimal
      effort if the particular code comprises shared libraries with DHCP4 and
      DHCP6 packets processing logic. The exact way how the server processes
      DHCPv4 traffic received over DHCPv6 is outside of scope for this document.</t>

      <t>Another desired use case is to process the v4 and v6 messages on two
      distinct servers - DHCP6 server processing only v6 messages and the DHCP4
      server processing only v4 messagess. The corresponding network topology
      has been shown on the <xref target="overview-dhcp4-and-dhcp6-server"/>.

      <t>The v4 message is initiated by the DHCP4 client and is relayed by
      the Relay in the same way as in the previous example. However, in this
      case the v6 and v4 messages are directed to different destinations.
      The v4 messages are relayed to the DHCP4 server using IPv4. Therefore,
      the following conditions MUST be met if the implementation supports this
      use case.
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The relay agents MUST be configurable so as respective destinations
        can be specified for v4 and v6 traffic. It MUST be possible to configure
        different server destinations for each protocol family.</t>
        <t>The relay agent adjacent to the DHCP4 server MUST be able to
        relay incoming DHCP4o6 messages using IPv4.</t>
        <t>The relay agent adjacent to the DHCP4 server MUST be able to
        receive relayed DHCP4 traffic from the server and relay it using
        DHCPv6 RELAY-REPL as described above.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>The former of the use cases described in this chapter MUST be supported
      by all implementations conforming to this specification. The support for
      the latter use case is optional.</t>
