    <t>This document describes a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 parameters in IPv6 networks by carrying DHCPv4 messages over DHCPv6 transport..</t>

	<section title="Introduction">
	  <t>As the migration to IPv6 continues to happen, IPv6 only networks will become more prevalent, and there will be a need to provide IPv4 as a service over these IPv6 only networks. Along with the ability to provide IPv4 addressing, there might also be a need to provide other IPv4 configuration parameters such as addresses for reaching IPv4 services. There are several approaches possible to provision such information and this document describes one such approach.

	<section title="Architecture Overview">
    <t>This mechanism works by carrying encapsulated DHCPv4 messages over DHCPv6 messages. One possible architecture detailing the usage of this mechanism is illustrated in the following Figure 1. In this architecture, the client is a DHCP client which can send and receive DHCPv4 message through a new type of DHCPv6 option, which is called DHCPv4 Message option. The format of the option is described in section 2. The client sends all its DHCPv6 packets, including the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 packets, to the well-known All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.</t>

  <section title="Method 1: DHCPv4 over DHCPv6">
  	<section title="Method Overview">
      <t>In this method, DHCP client will put DHCPv4 message into a
      DHCPv6 option, i.e. the dhcpv4-message option. The DHCP packets
      will be sent out as a DHCPv6 message.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Client Behavior">
      <t>In this method, the DHCPv4 messages, including DHCPDISCOVER,
      DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST, DHCPACK, etc, are conveyed in a newly
      defined DHCPv6 option mentioned in the former part. When the
      DHCP client requires an IPv4 address, it MUST generate a
      BOOTPREQUEST message to apply one from DHCP server. The DHCPv4
      message is wrapped in the dhcpv4-message option, which is then
      put into the Option field of DHCPv6 message.  The DHCP client
      sends out the constructed DHCPv6 message to the Well-Known
      multicast address, i.e. All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers
      multicast address as is defined in RFC[3315]. The DHCP relay
      agent receiving the message handles the message as a normal
      DHCPv6 relay agent in Section 20.1 of [RFC3315]. </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Relay Agent Behavior">
      <t>In this method, DHCP client and server are capable of
      communicating with each other directly, which does not
      necessitate any changes in DHCPv6 relay agent behavior.</t>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section title="Method 2: DHCPv4 over IPv6">
    <section title="Client Behavior">
       <t>In this case, the client is enabled to send and receive
       DHCPv4 messages through IPv6 sessions. The IPv6 UDP packet that
       has a DHCPv4 message as its payload is called DHCPv4 over IPv6
       packet. The client should use the port 546 as the destination
       port, and the port 547 as the source port of each DHCPv4 over
       IPv6 packet. </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Relay Agent Behavior">

       <t>The relay agent should also send and receive DHCPv4 messages
       through IPv6 on the interface facing to the client. It should
       listen for DHCPv4 over IPv6 packets on port 546, and send
       DHCPv4 over IPv6 packets on port 547.</t>

       <t>When the relay agent receives a BOOTPREQUEST message (i.e.,
       DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST, etc.), it constructs a new relay
       agent-forward message. It then copies the source IPv6 address
       from the header of the received DHCPv4 over IPv6 packet to the
       peer-address field of the relay agent-forward message. The
       relay agent copies the received BOOTPREQUEST message (excluding
       any IP or UDP headers) into the DHCPv4 Message option in the
       new message. It then forwards such a relay agent-forward
       message to the server.</t>

       <t>When the relay agent received a relay agent-relay message
       that includes the DHCPv4 Message option from the server, it
       should extract the DHCPv4 message from the DHCPv4 Message
       option of the message, and relay agent it to the address
       contained in the peer-address field of the relay agent-reply
       message.</t>

    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Server Behavior">
    <t>When a DHCPv6 server receives a valid DHCPv6 message, it checks
    for the presence of a DHCPv4 Message option. If it is present, the
    server processes the payload of the option as a DHCPv4
    message. The DHCPv4 message is handled by the DHCPv6 server itself
    (most likeley scenario) or forwarded to another DHCPv4 server.</t>

    <t>When sending out a DHCPv4 reply message, the DHCPv6 server MUST include a DHCPv4 Message option in an encapsulating DHCPv6 message that contains the DHCPv4 message as the option payload. </t>

    <t>DHCPv4 messages with the same transaction ID SHOULD NOT be
    transported inside DHCPv6 messages with different transaction
    IDs.</t>
