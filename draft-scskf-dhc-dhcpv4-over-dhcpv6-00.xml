      <t>This document describes a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 parameters
      in IPv6 networks by carrying DHCPv4 messages over DHCPv6 transport.

<middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As the migration to IPv6 continues to happen, IPv6 only networks
      will become more prevalent, and there will be a need to provide IPv4
      as a service over these IPv6 only networks. Along with the ability
      to provide IPv4 addressing, there might also be a need to provide
      other IPv4 configuration parameters such as addresses for reaching
      IPv4 services. There are several approaches possible to provision
      such information and this document describes one such approach.

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>BOOTREQUESTV6 (TBD)  A new type of DHCPv6 Client/Server message defined 
      	                   in this document. A client sends to a server 
                           a BOOTREQUESTV6 message, which contains a DHCPv4 Message 
                           Option. Each DHCPv4 Message Option contains a BOOTREQUEST
                           message that client used to request IPv4 configuration
                           parameters from the server.
      </t>
      <t>BOOTREPLYV6 (TBD)    A new type of DHCPv6 Client/Server message defined 
      	                   in this document. A server sends a BOOTREPLYV6 message, 
                           which contains a DHCPv4 Message Option, in response
                           to the BOOTREQUESTV6 message received from a client. 
                           Each DHCPv4 Message Option wrapped in a BOOTREPLYV6
                           message contains a BOOTREPLY message, which is the
                           response to the corresponding BOOTREQUEST message
                           in BOOTREQUESTV6 message received from the client.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Architecture Overview">
      <t>The architecture described in this document addresses the typical
      use case, where the DHCP client's uplink support IPv6 only and the
      Service Provider's network support IPv6 and limited IPv4 services which
      need to be accessed by the client over IPv6 only network.
      </t>

      <t>The DHCP clients can be running on CPE devices or end hosts, etc.
      At the time this document is written, DHCP clients on CPE devices are
      relatively easier to be modified comparing to those on end hosts. So this
      document takes the CPE as an example for describing the mechanism.
      This doesn't preclude end hosts from implementing the mechanism in the
      future. 
      </t>

      <t>This mechanism works by carrying encapsulated DHCPv4 messages over
      DHCPv6 messages. One possible architecture detailing the usage of this
      mechanism is illustrated in the <xref target="architecture-overview"/>.
      In this architecture, the client is a DHCP client which can send and
      receive DHCPv4 message using a new type of DHCPv6 message with a new 
      type of DHCPv6 option. The DHCPv6 message is called BOOTREQUESTV6 message,
      while the new option is DHCPv4 Message option. The format of the option
      is described in section 2. The client sends all its DHCPv6 packets, 
      including the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 packets, to the well-known 
      All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address on the DHCPv6 
      server port 547.
      </t>

      <t>The DHCPv6 packet can be transmitted either via Relay Agents or
      directly to the server. The server is referred in this document as
      "Unified Server" for its capability of processing regular DHCPv6
      traffic as well as DHCPv4 packets wrapped in the DHCPv4 Message
      Option. Server replies with a relevant DHCPv6 packet carrying
      DHCPv4 response wrapped with the DHCPv4 Message Option. The Client
      receives response on the port 546. </t>

  <section title="Method 1: DHCPv4 over DHCPv6">
    <section title="Method Overview">
      <t>In this method, DHCP client will put DHCPv4 message into a
      DHCPv6 option, i.e. the DHCPv4 Message Option. The DHCP packets
      will be sent out as a DHCPv6 message.</t>
    </section>
-->

    <section title="Client Behavior">
      <t>When the client requires an IPv4 address and/or other IPv4 configuration 
      parameters, it MUST generate a BOOTREQUEST message to apply them from a server.
      The BOOTREQUEST message is wrapped in the DHCPv4 Message Option, which is
      then put into the Option field of the BOOTREQUESTV6 message. Client MUST put
      exactly one DHCPv4 Message Option in a single BOOTREQUESTV6 message. The
      client sends out the BOOTREQUESTV6 message to the Well-Known multicast address,
      i.e. All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address defined in 
      <xref target="RFC3315"/>. </t>

      <t>When the client receives a BOOTREPLYV6 message, it MUST extract the BOOTREPLY
      message in the DHCPv4 Message Option of the message, and then handle
      the message as described in section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC2131"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Relay Agent Behavior">
    	<t>If the relay agent receives a BOOTREQUESTV6 message, it MUST handle the 
    	message as described in section 20.1.1 of <xref target="RFC3315"/>. 
      </t>
<!--
      <t>The DHCP relay agent will receive the DHCPv6 message containing
      DHCPv4 Message Option from the multicast interface. It then handles the
      message as a normal DHCPv6 relay agent as in Section 20.1 of 
      <xref target="RFC3315"/>.
      In this method, DHCP client and server are capable of communicating with
      each other directly, which does not necessitate any changes in
      DHCPv6 relay agent behavior.</t>
-->
    </section>

    <section title="Server Behavior">
    	<t>If the server receives a BOOTREQUESTV6 message from a client
        directly, it MUST extract the BOOTREQUEST message from the DHCPv4 
        Message Option in the BOOTREQUESTV6 message, and then hand it over
        to its DHCPv4 engine.</t>  

    	<t>The DHCPv4 engine of the server will response to a specific 
        BOOTREQUEST message as is defined in <xref target="RFC2131"/>. The
        server MUST wrap the message into the DHCPv4 Message Option and put
        the option into a BOOTREPLYV6 message. It then sends BOOTREPLYV6 
        message to the source IPv6 address of the received BOOTREQUESTV6 
        message.</t>

        <t>If the received BOOTREQUESTV6 message is relayed by relay agent(s),
        or the BOOTREPLYV6 message will be sent to a relay agent, the server
        MUST handle the messages as described in section 20 of 
        <xref target="RFC3315"/>. </t>
 	
<!--    	
      <t>Server receives DHCPv6 packets from the Relay Agent or directly
      from the Client. If it finds that received packet comprises the
      DHCPv4 Message Option it unpacks the content of this option and
      processes it as a regular DHCPv4 packet. The exact way how the
      server processes the DHCPv4 packet received over DHCPv6 protocol
      is out of the scope of this document.

 <section title="Method 2: DHCPv4 over IPv6">
    <section title="Client Behavior">
       <t>In this case, the client is enabled to send and receive
       DHCPv4 messages through IPv6 sessions. The IPv6 UDP packet that
       has a DHCPv4 message as its payload is called DHCPv4 over IPv6
       packet. The client should use the port 546 as the destination
       port, and the port 547 as the source port of each DHCPv4 over
       IPv6 packet. </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Relay Agent Behavior">

       <t>The relay agent should also send and receive DHCPv4 messages
       through IPv6 on the interface facing to the client. It should
       listen for DHCPv4 over IPv6 packets on port 546, and send
       DHCPv4 over IPv6 packets on port 547.</t>

       <t>When the relay agent receives a BOOTPREQUEST message (i.e.,
       DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST, etc.), it constructs a new relay
       agent-forward message. It then copies the source IPv6 address
       from the header of the received DHCPv4 over IPv6 packet to the
       peer-address field of the relay agent-forward message. The
       relay agent copies the received BOOTPREQUEST message (excluding
       any IP or UDP headers) into the DHCPv4 Message option in the
       new message. It then forwards such a relay agent-forward
       message to the server.</t>

       <t>When the relay agent received a relay agent-relay message
       that includes the DHCPv4 Message option from the server, it
       should extract the DHCPv4 message from the DHCPv4 Message
       option of the message, and relay agent it to the address
       contained in the peer-address field of the relay agent-reply
       message.</t>

    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Server Behavior">
    <t>When a DHCPv6 server receives a valid DHCPv6 message, it checks
    for the presence of a DHCPv4 Message Option. If it is not present,
    the server handles the DHCPv6 packet as is defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/>.
    If it is present, the server processes the payload of the option as a DHCPv4
    message. The DHCPv4 message is handled by the DHCPv6 server itself
    (most likely scenario) or forwarded to another DHCPv4 server.</t>

    <t>When sending out a DHCPv4 reply message, the DHCPv6 server MUST include
    a DHCPv4 Message Option in an encapsulating DHCPv6 message that contains 
    the DHCPv4 message as the option payload.
    </t>

    <t>DHCPv4 messages with the same transaction ID SHOULD NOT be
    transported inside DHCPv6 messages with different transaction
    IDs.</t>

  </section>
-->

<!--
  <section title="Lifetime Considerations">
    <t>When there is a binding table of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses related 
    to the DHCP server, a binding record may become invalid if the IPv6 
    address expires. The IPv4 address should be renewed when a client's 
    IPv6 address expires in this situation.
